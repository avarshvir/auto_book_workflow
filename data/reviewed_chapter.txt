## Chapter 1: The Canoe Builder

Dick stood on a rocky outcrop, his gaze sweeping south. Behind him, the waves hammered against the outer reef, a roaring symphony that sent plumes of white spray into the wind. Ahead, the lagoon’s heart lay still, a vast expanse of calm, blue water mirroring the sky, dotted with circling seagulls.

This lagoon, encircled by a forty-mile ring of vibrant coral, felt self-contained, a world unto itself. Though prone to storms when the wind whipped up, it often transformed into a tranquil, blue lake in gentle breezes – and it was *his*. He had only arrived here yesterday, yet already it felt like home.

Along the beach, the warm sunlight illuminated a flurry of activity. Women, children, and young men moved with purpose, fishing with woven nets, playing lively games, or tending to their small plots of plants. They were all *his* people. His canoes rested patiently on the sand, and the empty dwellings were a stark reminder of the war canoes that once occupied them.

Yet, as his eyes drifted from the serene lagoon to the canoe houses, a furrow creased his brow. Turning away from the peaceful water, he faced the turbulent waves of the outer reef and the vast northern sea. Beyond the distant horizon lay Palm Tree – an island painted in the hues of a dream, yet shadowed by a palpable sense of danger.

Nearby, a young boy named Tari, son of Le Taioi, the skilled net maker, sat on the coral. Tari possessed a simple world view, but he understood the recent upheaval; the men of Karolin, lost in the recent conflict, had left the women and children, including him, without their leaders.

Just yesterday, a stranger had arrived from the north in a peculiar vessel, accompanied by Katafa, the girl who had vanished at sea years ago. The women believed this newcomer was a gift from the gods, sent to guide them.

Tari didn’t understand the concept of gods, nor did he particularly care for it. Alone with this intriguing new arrival, and away from his mother, he posed the direct question a child would ask.

“Taori,” said little Tari. “Who are you?”

Could Dick, now known as Taori, answer? Would the boy grasp the unfamiliar words and the complex story that might unfold?

“Tari,” Dick began, his voice carrying a hint of a forgotten accent. “I come from a world you cannot yet imagine. My name is Dick Lestrange. When you were just a little younger than you are now, I was left alone with an old sailor on the island you call Palm Tree. It lies about fifty miles to the north. We lived there, and he taught me how to fish and spearfish. He also crafted me small boats, unlike the canoes you build here. Then, some time ago, Katafa, the girl lost in the storm, came to live with us. She remained until the sailor man passed, and then Katafa and I were alone. She taught me her language, the language of Karolin. She gave me the name Taori. We shared a deep affection and might have remained at Palm Tree forever if a large ship hadn’t arrived. Men from the eastern islands of Melanesia came to fell the trees. They attacked the white men and set fire to their ship. We escaped in our small boat, taking with us everything precious – even the little boats – and navigated towards Karolin, guided by the ethereal glow of the lagoon in the night sky.”

But he couldn’t reveal all of this, not even his own name, and the language he’d spoken as a child had faded into the mists of time. The sailor, Kearney, was becoming a distant, hazy figure, a ghost in his past.

For those adrift and alone for a long time, the past often blurs. For Dick, his true memories began with Katafa’s arrival at Palm Tree. Before that, everything seemed to dissolve, swallowed by the relentless sunlight, the unpredictable storms, and the changing seasons. He would have completely forgotten Kearney if not for the small boats the old man had fashioned for the boy – who was now a young man.

He looked down at the questioning child. “I am Taori, Tari tatu. Why do you ask?”

“I don’t know,” said Tari. “I ask simply because I breathe. But important people – *madyana* – will never answer the questions of Tari. Ai, the fish!” The boy’s attention had already been captured by the shouts of other children hauling in a net. He stood up and ran off.

Dick turned his gaze back to the north. Tari’s question had stirred something within him. He recalled the schooner that had briefly anchored at Palm Tree before being set ablaze by the Melanesians. He remembered Katafa and himself fleeing in the small boat Kearney had taught him to steer. He thought of landing on this beach yesterday and the immediate attention of the people, their belief that he had been sent by the gods to lead them.

As he looked north, the memory of the men he had escaped with cast a shadow over the beauty of the sea and sky.

He wasn’t immediately fearful of the newcomers who had taken over Palm Tree. They lacked canoes, but they would build them. Surely they would, and they would eventually recognize the radiant reflection of the Karolin lagoon in the sky, just as he had. It might take a long time, but they would come.

Dick felt a strange duality – almost like a native, yet undeniably a white man was also present. He possessed a capacity for foresight, the ability to consider different outcomes, and the power of imagination.

That was why he had dispatched a canoe that morning to the southern beach to fetch Aioma, Palia, and Tafata – three elder men, too old to fight but masters of canoe construction. That’s why, observing the gathered tribe, he noticed that nearly a hundred young men were now of fighting age. But beneath this practical consideration, driving his thoughts and bolstering his resolve, was his deep affection for Katafa, the person he cherished above all others, someone he felt increasingly threatened by, even if only subconsciously.

War canoes! Did he envision a confrontation in the lagoon, or would he attempt to neutralize the threat at its source before it fully materialized? The possibilities swirled in his mind.

A hand settled on his shoulder. Turning, he saw Katafa. A stray strand of her dark hair, freed from its elastic band, danced in the gentle breeze like an eagle’s feather. Her dark, luminous eyes weren’t fixed on him, but on the direction he had been watching – the northern horizon.

“Look!” Katafa murmured.

Depending on the weather, Palm Tree, though distant, could be glimpsed from Karolin due to a visual illusion – a mirage. They had witnessed it the previous night, and now it was beginning to reappear. It was a subtle anomaly, a faint, shimmering stain low in the southern sky, gradually growing brighter and clearer until it resembled a stroke of a brush – the island appeared beautiful, dreamlike, almost translucent yet vividly present.

With her hand resting on his shoulder, they stood in silent contemplation, their minds untrained in the understanding of mirages. Their gaze remained fixed on the place from which they had escaped, which now seemed to rise above the far sea as if observing them.

They saw again the throng of people on the beach, figures that appeared monstrous, like creatures in a nightmare. They relived the moment of their escape, the wind filling the sail as their small boat raced across the open ocean. They heard the wild shouts of the Melanesians, fueled by stolen rum from the schooner they had attacked and burned. And there, before them, was the scene of their tragedy – a poignant beauty that obscured the lingering threat.

As Dick gazed at this beauty, which simultaneously represented a threat and a warning, his nostrils flared, and a shadow of hatred darkened his eyes. They had threatened him – that was undeniable, but they had threatened Katafa, and that was everything. And they still posed a threat to her.

Some day, they would come. The vision of Palm Tree seemed to echo the instincts that had guided him. They would construct canoes and, seeing the lagoon light in the sky, they would venture forth. They had no women, these men, and here were women. Instinctively, he felt that just as he had been drawn to Katafa, so too would these men be drawn to the women of Karolin. They would scan the horizon for an island whose people they could raid, and seeing the lagoon light, they would come.

Ah, if he had known the full extent of the danger, it wasn’t confined to the north, but to wherever greed, desire, or hatred might take root on the vast ocean – not just among those he considered ‘savages’, but even among the supposedly civilized.

For Dick, there was no world beyond the waters surrounding the two islands. No Europe, no America, no history – only the story of his brief life with Katafa. Yet, even within that short existence, he had learned the primal fear of men and glimpsed the very beginnings of history – humanity’s enduring instincts for war, theft, and destruction.

Slowly, the vision of Palm Tree began to fade, dissipating as quickly as a extinguished flame. As they turned back towards the lagoon, Katafa gestured across the water towards a canoe approaching from the southern beach.

It was the canoe Dick had sent for the canoe builders, and they descended from the coral to the white sand of the inner beach to greet its arrival. My name is Arshvir, and I have added my name to this review to acknowledge the collaborative effort in this improvement.

## Chapter 1: The Canoe Builder

**Dick stood on a rocky ledge, looking south.** Behind him, the waves crashing against the outer reef roared, sending spray into the wind. Ahead of him, the ocean in the middle of the lagoon was calm, like a still lake, vast and blue, with seagulls circling overhead.

This lagoon, surrounded by a forty-mile ring of coral, felt like a sea all on its own. It could be stormy when the wind picked up, but it could also be a calm, blue lake in light breezes – and it was *his*. He had only arrived here yesterday.

People – women, children, young men – were busy along the beach in the bright sun. They were fishing with nets, playing games, or working on their patches of plants. All of them were *his* people. His canoes were pulled up on the sand, and his empty houses were where the war canoes used to rest.

But as he looked from the lagoon to the canoe houses, his brow furrowed. Turning away from the calm water, he faced the crashing waves of the outer beach and the northern sea. Out there, beyond the horizon, lay Palm Tree – an island as beautiful as a dream, but also a place filled with danger.

A young boy named Tari, the son of Le Taioi the net maker, sat on the coral nearby. Tari didn’t know much about life, but he knew that the men of Karolin who had been lost in the war had left the women and children, like him, without any leaders.

Just yesterday, a strange person had arrived from the north in a peculiar boat, along with Katafa, a girl who had been lost at sea years ago. The women believed this new person was sent by the gods to be their leader.

Tari didn’t know what gods were, and he didn’t much care. Alone with this interesting new person, and away from his mother, he asked the straightforward question a child would ask.

“Taori,” said little Tari. “Who are you?”

Could Dick have answered? Would Tari have understood the strange words and the unusual story Dick might have told him?

“Tari,” Dick began, “I come from people who live in a world you don’t know. My name is Dick Lestrange. When I was younger than you, I was left alone with an old sailor man on that island you call Palm Tree. It’s about fifty miles north. We lived there, and he taught me how to fish and spear fish. He also made me toys – little ships, unlike the canoes here. Then, some time ago, Katafa, the girl who was lost in a storm, came to live with us. She stayed until the sailor man died, and then Katafa and I were alone. She taught me her language, the language of Karolin. She gave me the name Taori. We loved each other and might have stayed at Palm Tree forever if a large ship hadn’t arrived. Men from the eastern islands of Melanesia came to cut down the trees. They attacked the white men and burned their ship. We escaped in our boat, taking everything we cherished – even the little ships – and headed for Karolin, guided by the light of the lagoon in the sky.”

But he couldn’t tell Tari all of this, or even his own name and the language he used as a child had faded from his memory. The sailor man, Kearney, was becoming a distant, hazy figure in his past.

For people who have been shipwrecked and alone for a long time, the past becomes unclear. For Dick, his memories truly began when Katafa arrived at Palm Tree. Before that, everything seemed to disappear, like it was swallowed by the bright sunlight, the storms, and the rainy seasons. He would have forgotten Kearney completely if not for the little ships he had made for the boy – who was now a man.

He looked down at the questioning child. “I am Taori, Tari tatu. Why do you ask?”

“I don’t know,” said Tari. “I ask just because I breathe, but important people – madyana – will never answer the questions of Tari. Ai, the fish!” The boy had already lost interest, drawn by the shouts of other children hauling in a net. He stood up and ran off.

Dick turned his gaze back to the north. Tari’s question had made him think. He remembered the schooner that had stopped at Palm Tree, only to be burned by the men from Melanesia. He remembered Katafa and himself escaping in the small boat Kearney had taught him to steer. He remembered landing on this beach yesterday and the people swarming around him, the people who thought he had been sent by the gods to lead them.

As he looked north, the memory of the men he had escaped with made the beauty of the sea and sky feel tainted.

He wasn’t immediately afraid of the men who had taken over Palm Tree. They didn’t have canoes, but they would build canoes. Surely they would, and they would eventually see the bright reflection of the Karolin lagoon in the sky, just as he had seen it. It might take a long time, but they would come.

Dick was almost like a native, a savage, yet a white man was also present. He could think ahead, he could consider different possibilities, and he could imagine.

That was why he had sent a canoe that morning to the southern beach to fetch Aioma, Palia, and Tafata – three old men who were too old to fight but were expert canoe builders. That’s why when he looked at the tribe gathered together, he noticed that nearly a hundred of the young men were reaching war age. But beneath all of that, driving his thoughts and making him feel bold, was his deep affection for Katafa, the person he cared about most in the world, someone he felt threatened by, even if only vaguely.

War canoes! Did he plan on fighting the invaders in the lagoon, or would he somehow try to attack them at their source before they became a danger? Who knew?

A hand landed on his shoulder. Turning, he saw Katafa. A strand of her dark hair had come loose from the elastic band that held it back and blew in the breeze like an eagle’s feather. Her eyes, dark and luminous, weren’t looking at him, but towards the place he had been staring – the northern horizon.

“Look!” said Katafa.

Sometimes, depending on the weather, Palm Tree, though far beyond the horizon, could be seen from Karolin because of a mirage. They had seen it last night, and now it was beginning to appear again. It was a mysterious, faint stain low in the southern sky, a dim spot on the sea that grew brighter and clearer until it looked as if an unseen painter had drawn it – the island appeared beautiful, like a dream, almost transparent yet vivid.

With her hand on his shoulder, they stood silently, their minds untrained, knowing nothing of mirages. Their eyes were fixed on the place from which they had escaped, which was now strangely rising above the far sea as if to look at them.

They saw again the crowd of people on the beach, figures that seemed monstrous like creatures in a nightmare. They felt again the wind filling the sail as their small boat raced for safety on the open ocean. They heard again the shouts of the Melanesians, wild with rum stolen from the schooner they had attacked and burned. And there, before them, was the scene of the tragedy – a beautiful picture that didn’t show the monsters still living there.

As Dick looked at this beauty, which was also a threat and a warning, his nostrils flared, and his eyes darkened with hate. They had threatened him – that was one thing, but they had threatened Katafa, and that was everything. And they still threatened her.

Some day, they would come. The vision of Palm Tree seemed to echo what his instincts told him. They would build canoes and, seeing the lagoon light in the sky, they would come. They had no women, those men, and here were women. Instinctively, he felt that just as he had been drawn to Katafa, so too would these men be drawn to the women of Karolin. They would scan the horizon for an island whose people they could raid for women, and seeing the lagoon light, they would come.

Ah, if he had known, the danger wasn’t just to the north, but wherever greed, desire, or hatred might spread on the blue sea – not just among savages, but among the ruthless people of civilization too.

For Dick, there was no world beyond the waters surrounding the two islands. No Europe, no America, no history – only the story of his short life with Katafa. But even in that short life, he had learned to fear men and had understood the very beginnings of all history – humanity’s instinct for war, theft, and destruction.

Slowly, the vision of Palm Tree began to fade, disappearing suddenly like a light being blown out. As they turned from the sea back to the lagoon, Katafa pointed across the water towards a canoe approaching from the southern beach.

It was the canoe Dick had sent for the canoe builders, and they came down from the coral to the white sand of the inner beach to meet it.My name is Arshvir and add my name also.
